# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Welcome to my Tic-Tac-Toe game! This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a fun and interactive way to play the game either against another player or against a computer.

## Live Demo

Check out the live demo [**Live Preview**](https://Vishrutkev.github.io/The_Odin_Project/Tic-Tac-Toe).

## Features

- Play against another player or against the computer (bot).
- Simple and intuitive interface.
- Keeps track of the score.
- Option to reset the game and start over.

## How to Play

1. Open the game in your web browser.
2. Choose your preferred game mode: Player vs. Player or Player vs. Bot.
3. Click on the cells to make your move.
4. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
5. If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

## Development

This project is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses modern web technologies to create a responsive and interactive game interface.

### Architecture

The project follows the module pattern and uses Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE) to encapsulate the game logic. This ensures that the game code is modular and prevents access to internal variables and functions from the console.

## Setup
